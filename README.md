# Downtown Providence Parking Analysis

This repository holds files for calculations of the insane amount of parking in Downtown Providence, RI.

Currently, all calculations are done in [`notebooks/calculations.ipynb`](notebooks/calculations.ipynb), and collected in
[`outputs.md`](outputs.md).

If youâ€™d like to work on these files, you will need to use [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/). The environment can be
recreated from [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

Data is retrieved from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx).
