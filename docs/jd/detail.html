			This page is generated from OpenStreetMap data, much of which was added by me. Therefore, these counts

		<h3>Street Parking</h3>
		<p>There are approximately <span class="figure">639</span> on-street parking spaces. Some are
			metered or otherwise restricted, others are not. In some areas, like on Eddy Street behind City Hall, people
			regularly park on sidewalks.</p>
		<p>If we approximate the dimensions of the average on-street parking space as <span
				class="figure">9 feet</span> by <span class="figure">17 feet</span>, we find that
			on-street parking accounts for <span class="figure">97,767.0 ft<sup>2</sup></span>. The total area of the Jewelry District
			neighborhood is <span class="figure">0.22 miles<sup>2</sup></span>, so street parking accounts for approximately
			<span class="figure">1.62%</span> of the Jewelry District&rsquo;s land area.</p>

		<h3>Surface Parking</h3>
		<p>&ldquo;Surface parking&rdquo; refers to parking lots that are exclusively on ground level and are typically
			uncovered.</p>
		<p>There are roughly <span class="figure">3,516</span> spaces in <span
				class="figure">103</span> surface lots. The average capacity of surface lots is <span
				class="figure">34.1</span>, and the median capacity is <span
				class="figure">18</span>.</p>
		<p>Surface lots, combined, have a surface area of <span class="figure">1,175,849.01 ft<sup>2</sup></span> (<span
				class="figure">0.0422 mi<sup>2</sup></span>), which translates into roughly <span
				class="figure">19.44%</span> of the District land area. The average area of these is
			<span class="figure">11,416.01 ft<sup>2</sup></span>, and the median is <span
				class="figure">6,910.98 ft<sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
		<p>Unlike on-street parking, which is typically parallel and relatively space-efficient, parking lots often have
			inner service roads or lanes, so that cars have space to turn around and maneuver. Given the total area and
			number of spaces, we can calculate that each individual parking space is responsible for an area of <span
				class="figure">363.0 ft<sup>2</sup></span>. If the average spot is assumed to be <span
				class="figure">9 feet</span> &#215; <span class="figure">17 feet</span> = <span
				class="figure">153 ft<sup>2</sup></span>, each surface space accounts for an additional <span
				class="figure">210.15 ft<sup>2</sup></span> (<span class="figure">57.87%</span>) for service roads,
			turn-around space, etc.</p>
		<p class="note"><em>Note:</em> some commuter lots have notably higher space efficiencies because they block cars
			in.</p>
		<p>OpenStreetMap has a <span class="mono">capacity:disabled</span> tag to indicate the number of spaces which
			are considered (in the US), to be handicapped-accessible. I&rsquo;ve done my best to catalogue these, but
			paint or signs indicating this in many lots is faded or out of date, so counts may be notably low. That
			said, the current data on OpenStreetMap suggests that there are <span
				class="figure">75</span> of these accessible spaces in <span
				class="figure">29</span> surface lots, approximately <span
				class="figure">2.13%</span> of the total count of surface lots spaces. Lots
			with <em>any</em> disabled spaces have an average of <span class="figure">2.59</span> accessible
			spaces (median of <span class="figure">2.0</span> accessible spaces).

			<h3>Structured Parking</h3>
			<p>&ldquo;Structured parking&rdquo; refers to multi-story, above-ground structures with a primary purpose of
				providing parking, indicated by the OpenStreetMap <span class="mono">multi-storey</span> tag.</p>
			<p>There are roughly <span class="figure">3,264</span> spaces in <span
					class="figure">4</span> structured lots. The average capacity of structured
				lots is <span class="figure">816</span>, and the median is <span
					class="figure">832</span>.</p>
			<p>Structured lots, combined, have a surface area of <span class="figure">161,203.85 ft<sup>2</sup></span>. The
				average structured lot area is <span class="figure">40,300.96 ft<sup>2</sup></span>, with a median of <span
					class="figure">36,319.59 ft<sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
			<p>If we calculate the average area per space, we find that it is <span
					class="figure">52.25 ft<sup>2</sup></span>, <span
					class="figure">85.61%</span> lower than the average space required for a
				surface space.</p>
			<p><span class="figure">0</span> accessible spaces in structured garages have
				been indicated in the OpenStreetMap data. However, several garages do not publish this information and
				have not, as of yet, responded to my requests for it. Thus, there is low confidence in this
				figure&hellip; it is likely higher.</p>

			<h3>Underground Parking</h3>
			<p>Unsurprisingly, this refers to garages that are entirely underground.</p>
			<p>There are roughly <span class="figure">0</span> spaces in <span
					class="figure">0</span> underground lots. The average capacity of underground
				lots is <span class="figure">nan</span>, and the median is <span
					class="figure">nan</span>.</p>
			<p>While some area is used for entrance/exit ramps to these garages, it is negligible and will not be
				considered.</p>
			<p><span class="figure">0</span> accessible underground spaces have been
				indicated in the OpenStreetMap data. As with structured parking, this figure has low confidence and is
				likely higher than reported here.</p>

			<h2>Data Download</h2>

			<p>Here are some (possibly) useful CSVs you can download. &ldquo;area&rdquo;s are in square meters, and
				&ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; is a measure of area per space in square meters. Indices are OSM IDs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="./files/stats.csv" download>stats.csv</a>: contains a whole bunch of precalculated
					capacities, areas, means, medians, and more.</li>
				<li><a href="./files/fp_surface.csv" download>fp_surface.csv</a>: Contains calculations for individual
					surface lots.</li>
				<li><a href="./files/fp_structured.csv" download>fp_structured.csv</a>: Contains calculations for
					individual structured garages.</li>
				<li><a href="./files/fp_underground.csv" download>fp_underground.csv</a>: Contains calculations for
					individual underground garages.</li>
				<li><a href="./files/street_capacities.csv" download>street_capacities.csv</a>: Contains capacities for
					various street segments.</li>
